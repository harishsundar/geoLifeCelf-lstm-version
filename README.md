# geoLifeCelf-lstm-version
This project was my final year project. This is for predicting the species that most probable to grow in a given environment using LSTM and CNN
Dataset:https://www.imageclef.org/node/229
The input is the environments of 3300 different plants with each plant having more than one instances.
The input is in the form of tiff images containing 33 environmental features such a precipitation map,humidity map etc.
I used Darwin's taxonomy to reduce the search space and improve the results .
